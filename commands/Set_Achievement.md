# Set_Achievement

## Parameters

### Required:

**Parameter1**: A string representing the name of the achievement to unlock.

### Optional:

*No optional parameters*

## Functionality

Unlocks the achievement, given it exists. Achievements with multiple unlock conditions are not supported (kind of).

In Greyling Grove, the achievement implementation allows for achievements to have 'requirements', which themselves are like hidden achievements, which can be used to create achievements that require multiple conditions or for something to happen multiple times.
