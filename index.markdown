# What is Oyster?

Oyster is a scripting language designed for use within games. It exists as a standalone library, which can be placed into a game engine along with an engine-specific implementation of its abstract types to allow for it to work with said engine.

Oyster itself can be found at [this page](https://github.com/HeckingGoose/Oyster).

# How do I write Oyster scripts?

For information on how to write Oyster scripts, check [here](writingscripts).

# What commands are supported?

For information on which commannds are supported in Oyster, check [here](supportedcommands).

# Can I write new commands for Oyster?

Oyster is designed to be expanded upon with custom commands that can be written by developers using Oyster (as a matter of fact under [Supported Commands](supportedcommands), the game specific commands are implemented via this expandability!). For information on how to write your own commands for your own projects involving Oyster, check out [this page](writingnewcommands).

# What if my game engine doesn't have an implementation for it yet?

You can write your own game engine specific implementation of Oyster's abstract classes! Information on what you'll need to implement can be found [here](newengineimplementations).

# But like, how does this all work internally?

If you're curious about how Oyster works internally, a write-up can be found [here](howitworksinternally).
